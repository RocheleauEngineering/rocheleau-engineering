        <h1 class="blog-title">From Mechanical to Code: Why I Built My Portfolio Website from Scratch</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">An engineer’s case for building from first principles</p>
    
        <p>I’m Carmina, a mechanical engineer by training and a builder at heart. My projects have taken me from lab benches and CNC mills to cleanrooms and CFD simulations. When it came time to showcase my work, I wanted a portfolio that felt engineered, not just assembled. So I built this website from scratch.</p>
    
        <img src="images/blog/post_1/blog-post-1.jpg" alt="Design sketches and layout planning" class="blog-image full">
    
        <p>No templates. No WordPress. Just clean code, deliberate choices, and a desire to learn something new—the same way I learned SolidWorks or MATLAB: by doing.</p>
    
        <h2>Why Build It Myself?</h2>
        <p>As engineers, we often talk about trade-offs like speed versus control or complexity versus elegance. I could have launched something quickly using a website builder, but that would have hidden the very skills I wanted to highlight: systems thinking, technical problem solving, and design from first principles.</p>
    
        <blockquote class="pull-quote">"There’s something powerful about building your own tools—even digital ones."</blockquote>
    
        <p>By coding the site with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I was able to:</p>
        <ul class="clean-list">
          <li>Optimize page load time to under 1.5s on mobile</li>
          <li>Implement modular structure for scalability</li>
          <li>Debug and test across browsers with intention</li>
          <li>Match layout precisely to my content needs</li>
        </ul>
    
       
        <img src="images/blog/post_2/blog-post-1.jpg" alt="Live coding interface and DevTools open" class="blog-image side right">
    
        <h2>Design with Intention</h2>
        <p>Color choices weren’t just aesthetic; they were guided by visual ergonomics. I selected soft blues and muted golds for high-contrast readability without eye fatigue. Every margin and font weight was adjusted to reduce cognitive load and create a smooth, readable flow.</p>
    
        <p>The layout reflects how I think: organized hierarchy, simplicity, and responsiveness. Typography is carefully weighted. Animations are minimal and purposeful. It’s all about clarity and control, similar to tuning a damping ratio in a real system.</p>
    
        <h2>What I Gained Technically</h2>
        <p>I approached this the same way I would a physical prototype: design, build, test, and iterate. In doing so, I:</p>
        <ul class="clean-list">
          <li>Wrote over 1,200 lines of custom CSS</li>
          <li>Built an interactive JS project gallery without frameworks</li>
          <li>Practiced version control using Git and GitHub</li>
          <li>Ran Lighthouse audits to validate performance and accessibility</li>
        </ul>
    
  
        <img src="images/blog/post_1/blog-post-3.jpg"" alt="Preview of final site interface" class="blog-image side left">
    
        <p>I also learned to debug like an engineer—reading console errors like failure logs and isolating issues like using a multimeter. I now understand the front-end stack not just visually, but structurally and functionally.</p>
    
        <h2>Why It Was the Right Call</h2>
        <p>This site does more than showcase projects. It demonstrates how I solve problems and learn quickly. The skills I practiced such as modular thinking, performance optimization, and user experience design apply directly to engineering design, systems integration, and technical documentation.</p>
    
        <p>I didn’t just publish a website. I delivered a solution with traceable design decisions, intentional architecture, and measurable outcomes. That, to me, is the essence of good engineering.</p>
    
        <h2>What’s Next?</h2>
        <p>This site will continue to evolve. I plan to add a technical writing blog, expand the image gallery with a dynamic JS masonry layout, and eventually refactor to React or Vue to scale functionality further.</p>
    
        <p>If you're an engineer thinking of building your own site, I encourage you to go for it. Not because it’s easy, but because it challenges you to think like a designer, a developer, and a systems engineer all at once.</p>
